The majority of the code we developed throughout the semester lies within villers_boys_ii/lib, the remaining is mostly generated automatically by flutter. With some exceptions for the villers_boys/images (icons from other sources, references within villers_boys_ii/lib/constants.dart). Some of the files within the villers_boys_ii/android folder have also been modified.

# Software
Flutter - https://flutter.dev/ \
Android Studio - https://developer.android.com/studio 

# Compile and Run

1. Install Flutter and Android Studio by following the guide at https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install. The "Set up your Android device" or "Set up the Android emulator" sections can be skipped depending on how you intend to run the application. See 4. for options.

2. Install the flutter and dart extensions for Android Studio.
  
    1. Start Android Studio.
    2. Open plugin preferences.
    3. Select the Flutter plugin and click Install.
    4. Click Yes when prompted to install the Dart plugin.
    5. Click Restart when prompted.

3. Open the Tyred code base in Android Studio. Open viller_boys_ii folder instead of root folder.

4. Choose emulation method. There a variety of methods, the ones used within the development of Tyred are:
    1. Using Chrome (Web). - This is the simplest and easiest to run but does not give full experience of application.
    2. Using an emulator. - This givs a better understanding of the application but is still missing some feateures, like vibration alerts.
    3. Using an Android device. - This is the most difficult emulation method, as it requires an android device. But will give the most accurate representation of Tyred.

5. Select emulation method then run 'main.dart'
